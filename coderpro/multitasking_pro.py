# Task Scheduler
# Given a characters array tasks, representing the tasks a CPU needs to do, where each letter represents a different task. 
# Tasks could be done in any order. Each task is done in one unit of time. 
# For each unit of time, the CPU could complete either one task or just be idle.
# However, there is a non-negative integer n that represents the cooldown period between two same tasks (the same letter in the array), that is that there must be at least n units of time between any two same tasks.
# Return the least number of units of times that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks.
# Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
# Output: 8
# Explanation: 
# A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B
# There is at least 2 units of time between any two same tasks.


# Others suggested the same algo, so this is the Python version.
# Rationale: Start with a single task with frequency m=3 (["A", "A", "A"]) and n=2. We simply need (m-1) * (n+1)+1: "A--A--A". It is m-1 sequences of n+1 length, and then the last task.
# Next:
# If A is not the only longest, e.g. AAABBBCCC, we will need +3 in the end rather than +1.
# We cannot go shorter than len(tasks), for the case of AAABCDEFGHI, hence the max in the last line.
