# Merge Intervals
# Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, 
# and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.
# Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
# Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
